## üß† MAC Address Types in ESP32

| Type                  | Description                                                                 | Permanence       | Source Function                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Factory MAC**       | Burned by Espressif during production                                        | Permanent (eFuse) | `esp_efuse_mac_get_default()`             |
| **Custom MAC**        | Burned by user into eFuse (write-once)                                       | Permanent (eFuse) | `esp_efuse_mac_get_custom()`              |
| **Base MAC (Software)** | Temporary override used to derive interface MACs (Wi-Fi, BT, etc.)         | Volatile (RAM)    | `esp_base_mac_addr_set()`                |

## üîß Behavior Summary

- **Factory MAC**: Always available, read-only, safe fallback.
- **Custom MAC**: Optional, burned once into eFuse, cannot be changed.
- **Base MAC (Software)**: Can be set at runtime before initializing interfaces. Overrides factory/custom MAC temporarily.

## üîÅ Switching Between MACs

You can choose which MAC to use at boot:
- Use factory: `esp_efuse_mac_get_default()` ‚Üí `esp_base_mac_addr_set()`
- Use custom: `esp_efuse_mac_get_custom()` ‚Üí `esp_base_mac_addr_set()`
- Use temporary MAC (e.g. from NVS or flash): just pass it to `esp_base_mac_addr_set()`

‚ö†Ô∏è Once interfaces like Wi-Fi or Ethernet are initialized, the base MAC is locked for that session.

## üîí eFuse Notes

- eFuse bits are **write-once**: once set to `1`, they cannot be reset.
- Factory MAC is **always read-only**.
- Custom MAC must be burned carefully ‚Äî irreversible.

## üß∞ Key Functions

| Function                          | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `esp_base_mac_addr_set()`        | Sets base MAC used to derive interface MACs |
| `esp_efuse_mac_get_default()`    | Gets factory MAC from eFuse                 |
| `esp_efuse_mac_get_custom()`     | Gets custom MAC from eFuse (if burned)      |

If you‚Äôre building a boot-time MAC selection system, you can combine these with NVS or config flags to dynamically choose the MAC source. Want help sketching that logic out?
